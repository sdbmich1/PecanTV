# Video Playback Guide

## Why Videos Stop After 8 Seconds

The 8-second playback issue is common with large video files and can be caused by:

1. **Buffering**: Videos are 1080p quality and need time to buffer
2. **Network**: Unstable internet connection interrupts streaming
3. **Device Memory**: Other apps using device memory
4. **iOS Limitations**: iOS video player has buffering limits

## Solutions

### For Users:

2. **Close Apps**: Close other apps to free up memory
3. **Wait to Buffer**: Let video load for 10-15 seconds before playing
4. **Try Browser**: Open video in Safari/Chrome as alternative
5. **Restart App**: Force close and reopen the app

### Technical Solutions:
